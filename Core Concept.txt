Meta-Coding:
The program generates or modifies Python code dynamically to achieve specific goals. For example, if the user specifies "optimize sorting," the script may replace a basic bubble sort with a quicksort algorithm.

Self-Testing:
The generated code is tested in a sandbox environment using test cases to ensure it meets the intended functionality without introducing errors.

Version Control:
Changes are logged using Git or another version control system, allowing the user to track the scriptâ€™s evolution and rollback changes if necessary.

Objective-Driven Evolution:
Users provide high-level objectives or performance metrics (e.g., speed, memory usage, or adding features). The program adjusts itself to meet these metrics over iterations.
