Programming Techniques:
    Meta-Programming: Use Pythonâ€™s exec(), eval(), or abstract syntax tree (ast) module to modify and execute code dynamically.
    Sandboxing: Execute generated code in a secure and isolated environment (e.g., Docker or custom sandbox).

AI Models:
    Use an API like OpenAI Codex or Hugging Face Transformers for generating intelligent code suggestions.

Testing Frameworks:
    Integrate with unittest, pytest, or custom frameworks for testing generated code.

Version Control:
    Use libraries like GitPython for automating version tracking.
