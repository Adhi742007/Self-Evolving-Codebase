    [input by user]: Optimize function 'calculate_distance' for speed.

    Code Generator Output: The system analyzes calculate_distance and suggests replacing a nested loop with a vectorized approach using NumPy.

Generated Code:

    [python code]: import numpy as np

                  def calculate_distance(points):
                      # Using NumPy for vectorized computation
                      distances = np.sqrt(np.sum(points**2, axis=1))
                      return distances

Validation:

    Runs tests to ensure functionality is intact.
    Benchmarks runtime to verify optimization.

Versioning:

    Commits the change to the repository with a message:

    [arduino code]:  Optimized calculate_distance using NumPy for faster execution.
