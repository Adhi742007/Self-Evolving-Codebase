Initialization:
    The base script starts with a set of predefined tasks or modules.
    The user specifies objectives (e.g., "minimize runtime for Task X" or "add feature Y").

Code Generator:
    Uses AI models like OpenAI Codex or GPT-4 to write new functions or modify existing ones.
    Implements meta-programming for dynamic changes at runtime.

Testing & Validation:
    Newly generated code is tested with a predefined suite of unit tests or benchmarks.
    If a change fails, it is discarded or debugged.

Versioning:
    Successful updates are committed to a Git repository with detailed logs of the changes.
    Reverts to previous stable versions if errors occur.

Feedback Loop:
    The system learns from failed changes, improving future suggestions.
    Could integrate reinforcement learning to fine-tune its decision-making process.
